   <h1>Hawaiin Sausage Skillet</h1>
   <p>I made this up one day when I couldn't find a recipe anywhere with these ingredients. So I kind of threw it together on a whim. Sugar can be adjusted for sweetness, and if the sauce gets a bit thicker than desired I suggest adding a little chicken broth as it's thickening. Serve immediately over rice.</p>

   <h2>Preparation </h2>
   <ul>
       <li>Prep time 15 mins</li>
       <li>Cook Time 20 mins</li>
       <li>Total Time 35 mins</li>
       <li>Servings 6</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more to taste</li>
       <li>1 (16 ounce) package Polish sausage, or to taste, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
       <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
       <li>¾ fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
       <li>½ cup pineapple juice, or more to taste</li>
       <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar, or to taste</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.</li>
       <li>Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Chefs Tip</h3>
   <p>You can use orange juice instead of pineapple juice if preferred.</p>
